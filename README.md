# Medical Health Insurance Cost Prediction

This project focuses on predicting medical health insurance costs using
machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze key personal
and lifestyle factors that influence insurance charges and build an
accurate predictive model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview

Healthcare costs vary significantly based on multiple factors such as
age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. This project applies supervised
machine learning models to estimate insurance charges based on these
parameters.

The complete workflow includes: - Data preprocessing\
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
- Feature engineering\
- Model training and evaluation\
- Prediction and performance comparison
